                        <p>Fig.1: The drinking machine at Ratty provides various drinks for students. Its default home screen shows buttons for water, other drinks, and filter options. A grey drink button indicates unavailability. Once a button is pressed, it proceeds to a drink screen that shows flavor options and calorie information. After making the final selection, the user can press their cups against outlets for either ice or drink.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p style="font-weight:bold">Obvious "Water" Button on Home Screen:</p>
                        <p>All interviewees expected easy access to hydration, and they most frequently get water. They were satisfied with the standalone "water" button, though interviewee A suggested that making water the default option would be ideal.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold">Grouping of the Drinks on Home Screen: </p>
                        <p>All interviewees chose drink and flavor while using the machine. The clear organization of the home screen helps the decision-making process, as it places the most common beverage choice - soda - in the middle.
                            However, interviewee C found some side groups confusing, and that adding a title to each group indicating the type of drinks would be helpful.

                    </li>

                        <p style="font-weight:bold">Inconspicuous Filter Options on Home Screen:</p>
                        <p>None of the interviewees noticed the filter options at the bottom of the home screen, and they suggested a better presentation of those layouts would be helpful.</p>

                                        Interviewee B suggested that different drinking machines in the same dining hall should communicate and indicate if a drink is available in another machine.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Interviewee C complained that a drink logo stays colored even if some flavors are gone.
                                    </li>

                                        Interviewee B hoped to choose dilution levels (mix drink and water) with one iteration.
